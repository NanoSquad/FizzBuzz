This is a repository for any code you want to share with the class, be it something that's useful, or just cool :)

Standards: 
The standards aren't strict, but you should follow basic coding practices (descriptive names for variables, etc.)
At the top of every file, please include:
 - The name of the file
 - Your name (If you weren't the creator of the file, list your name under "Contributors")
 - The date it was created
 - Brief description of the program
This makes it nicer to work with in a text editor

That's all!
